textacy: NLP, before and after spaCy
====================================

``textacy`` is a Python library for performing a variety of natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, built on the high-performance ``spacy`` library. With the
fundamentals --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. ---
delegated to another library, ``textacy`` focuses on the tasks that come before
and follow after.

**Note:** Docs used to be hosted on ReadTheDocs, but the builds stopped working
many months ago, and now those docs are out-of-date. This is unfortunate, especially
since ReadTheDocs allows for multiple versions while GitHub Pages does not.
I'll keep trying on ReadTheDocs; if the build issues ever get resolved, I'll
switch the docs back.
