Installation
============

The simplest way to install ``textacy`` is via ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install textacy

or ``conda``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c conda-forge textacy

**Note:** Some dependencies have been made optional, because they can be difficult
to install or are only needed in certain uses cases. See the next section for details.
To install all optional dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install textacy[all]

If you prefer --- or are obliged --- to do things the hard way, you can download
and unzip the source ``tar.gz`` from  PyPi, then install manually:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


Dependencies
------------

Given the multi-purpose breadth of its functionality, ``textacy`` depends on a
number of other Python packages. Most of these are typical components in the
PyData stack, but a few are more niche, and a couple have been known to cause
trouble during the installation process.

For example, to use visualization functions, you'll need ``matplotlib`` installed;
you can do so via ``pip install textacy[viz]``. For automatic language detection,
you'll need ``cld2-cffi`` installed; do ``pip install textacy[lang]``.

Downloading Data
----------------

For most uses of ``textacy``, language-specific model data in ``spacy`` is
required. Fortunately, ``spacy`` makes the process of getting this data easy and
flexible; just follow `the instructions in its docs <https://spacy.io/docs/usage/models>`_,
which also includes a list of `currently-supported languages and their models
<https://spacy.io/usage/models#section-available>`_.

``textacy`` itself features convenient access to several datasets comprised of
thousands of text + metadata records. Data can be downloaded via the ``.download()``
method on corresponding dataset classes (see :ref:`ref-api-datasets` for details)
or directly from the command line.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m textacy download capitol_words

will download and save a compressed json file with ~11k speeches given by the
main protagonists of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election (that had previously
served in the U.S. Congress). For more options, run

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m textacy --help
