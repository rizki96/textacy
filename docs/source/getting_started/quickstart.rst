Quickstart
==========

First things first: Import the package. Most functionality is available from
this top-level import, but we'll see that some features require their own imports.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import textacy

Working with Text
-----------------

Let's start with a single text document:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> text = (
    ...     'Since the so-called "statistical revolution" in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, '
    ...     'much Natural Language Processing research has relied heavily on machine learning. '
    ...     'Formerly, many language-processing tasks typically involved the direct hand coding '
    ...     'of rules, which is not in general robust to natural language variation. '
    ...     'The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference '
    ...     'to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora '
    ...     'of typical real-world examples.')

**Note:** In almost all cases, ``textacy`` (as well as ``spacy``) expects to be
working with unicode text data. Throughout the code, this is indicated as ``str``
to be consistent with Python 3's default string type; users of Python 2, however,
must be mindful to use ``unicode``, and convert from the default (bytes) string
type as needed.

Before (or *in lieu of*) processing this text with spaCy, we can do a few things.
First, let's look for keywords-in-context, as a quick way to assess, by eye,
how a particular word or phrase is used in a body of text:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> textacy.text_utils.KWIC(text, 'language', window_width=35)
     1980s and mid 1990s, much Natural  Language  Processing research has relied hea
    n machine learning. Formerly, many  language -processing tasks typically involve
    s not in general robust to natural  language  variation. The machine-learning pa

Sometimes, "raw" text is messy and must be cleaned up before analysis; other
times, an analysis simply benefits from well-standardized text. In either case,
the ``textacy.preprocessing`` module contains a number of functions to remove
URLs, punctuation, accents, HTML cruft, etc. as well as normalize whitespace.
For example:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> textacy.preprocess_text(text, lowercase=True, no_punct=True)
    'since the so called statistical revolution in the late 1980s and mid 1990s much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning formerly many language processing tasks typically involved the direct hand coding of rules which is not in general robust to natural language variation the machine learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora of typical real world examples'

Make a Doc
----------

Usually, though, we want to work with text that's been processed by spaCy:
tokenized, part-of-speech tagged, parsed, and so on. Since spaCy's pipelines
are language-dependent, we have to load a particular pipeline to match the text;
when working with texts from multiple languages, this can be a pain. Fortunately,
``textacy`` includes automatic language detection to apply the right pipeline
to the text, and it caches the loaded language data to minimize wait time and
hassle. Making a ``Doc`` from text is easy:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> doc = textacy.Doc(text)
    >>> doc
    Doc(85 tokens; "Since the so-called "statistical revolution" in...")

Under the hood, the text has been identified as English, and the default English-
language (``"en"``) pipeline has been loaded, cached, and applied to it. If you
need to customize the pipeline, you can still easily load and cache it, then
specify it yourself when initializing the doc:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> en = textacy.load_spacy('en_core_web_sm', disable=('parser',))
    >>> textacy.Doc(text, lang=en)
    Doc(85 tokens; "Since the so-called "statistical revolution" in...")

Oftentimes, text data comes paired with metadata, such as a title, author, or
publication date. ``textacy`` makes it easy to keep these together:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> metadata = {
    ...     'title': 'Natural-language processing',
    ...     'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing',
    ...     'source': 'wikipedia',
    ... }
    >>> doc = textacy.Doc(text, metadata=metadata)
    >>> doc.metadata['title']
    'Natural-language processing'

For some use cases, a ``textacy.Doc`` can be treated like a convenient wrapper
around an underlying ``spacy.Doc``; if you need them, the key spaCy objects
associated with the text are readily accessible as attributes: ``Doc.spacy_doc``,
``Doc.spacy_vocab``, and ``Doc.spacy_stringstore``. When possible, functions accept
either a ``textacy.Doc`` or a ``spacy.Doc`` as input. Check the docstrings
if you're not sure!

Analyze a Doc
-------------

There are many ways to understand the content of a ``Doc``. For starters, let's
extract various elements of interest:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> list(textacy.extract.ngrams(
    ...     doc, 3, filter_stops=True, filter_punct=True, filter_nums=False))

    [late 1980s, mid 1990s, Natural Language Processing]
    >>> pattern = textacy.constants.POS_REGEX_PATTERNS['en']['NP']
    >>> pattern
    '<DET>? <NUM>* (<ADJ> <PUNCT>? <CONJ>?)* (<NOUN>|<PROPN> <PART>?)+'
    >>> list(textacy.extract.pos_regex_matches(doc, pattern))

We can also identify key terms in a document by a number of algorithms:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import textacy.keyterms  # note the import
    >>> textacy.keyterms.textrank(doc, normalize='lemma', n_keyterms=10)
    [('language', 0.06469840439566026),
     ('rule', 0.05652651341294322),

     ('statistical', 0.04292595119686373),
     ('natural', 0.04177948765003742),
     ('world', 0.03970175136498526),
     ('real', 0.037150947215394275),
     ('typical', 0.03554707044022466),
     ('corpora', 0.034313898275359044),
     ('large', 0.0330254168906275)]
    >>> textacy.keyterms.sgrank(doc, ngrams=(1, 2, 3, 4), normalize='lower', n_keyterms=0.1)
    [('natural language processing research', 0.31188112358833325),
     ('natural language variation', 0.09554941648195946),

     ('general robust', 0.040647628278589344),
     ('statistical revolution', 0.03898147636679938)]

Or we can compute basic counts and various readability statistics:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> ts = textacy.TextStats(doc)
    >>> ts.n_unique_words
    57
    >>> ts.basic_counts
    {'n_chars': 414,
     'n_long_words': 30,
     'n_monosyllable_words': 38,
     'n_polysyllable_words': 19,
     'n_sents': 3,
     'n_syllables': 134,
     'n_unique_words': 57,
     'n_words': 73}
    >>> ts.flesch_kincaid_grade_level
    15.56027397260274
    >>> ts.readability_stats
    {'automated_readability_index': 17.448173515981736,
     'coleman_liau_index': 16.32928468493151,
     'flesch_kincaid_grade_level': 15.56027397260274,
     'flesch_reading_ease': 26.84351598173518,
     'gulpease_index': 44.61643835616438,
     'gunning_fog_index': 20.144292237442922,
     'lix': 65.42922374429223,
     'smog_index': 17.5058628484301,
     'wiener_sachtextformel': 11.857779908675797}

Lastly, we can transform a document into a "bag of terms", with flexible weighting
and term inclusion criteria:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> bot = doc.to_bag_of_terms(
    ...     ngrams=(1, 2, 3), named_entities=True, weighting='count',
    ...     as_strings=True)
    >>> sorted(bot.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:15]
    [('language', 3),
     ('call', 2),
     ('statistical', 2),
     ('natural', 2),
     ('machine', 2),
     ('rule', 2),
     ('learn', 2),
     ('natural language', 2),
     ('late 1980', 1),
     ('mid 1990', 1),
     ('natural language processing', 1),
     ('since', 1),
     ('revolution', 1),
     ('late', 1),
     ('1980', 1)]

Working with *Many* Texts
-------------------------

Many NLP tasks require datasets comprised of a large number of texts, which
are often stored on disk in one or multiple files. ``textacy`` makes it easy
to efficiently stream text (+metadata) records from disk, regardless of the
format or compression of the data.

Let's start with a single text file, where each line is a new text document::

    I love Daylight Savings Time: It's a biannual opportunity to find and fix obscure date-time bugs in your code. Can't wait for next time!
    Somewhere between "this is irritating but meh" and "blergh, why haven't I automated this yet?!" Fuzzy decision boundary.
    Spent an entire day translating structured data blobs into concise, readable sentences. Human language is hard.
    ...

In this case, the texts are tweets from my sporadic presence on Twitter ---
a fine example of small (and boring) data. Let's stream it from disk so we
can analyze it in ``textacy``:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> texts = textacy.io.read_text('../../Desktop/burton-tweets.txt', lines=True)
    >>> for text in texts:
    ...     doc = textacy.Doc(text)
    ...     print(doc)
    Doc(32 tokens; "I love Daylight Savings Time: It's a biannual o...")
    Doc(28 tokens; "Somewhere between "this is irritating but meh" ...")
    Doc(20 tokens; "Spent an entire day translating structured data...")
    ...

Okay, let's not *actually* analyze my ramblings on social media...

Instead, let's consider a more complicated dataset: a compressed JSON file in the
mostly-standard "lines" format, in which each line is a separate record with both
text data and metadata fields. As an example, we can use the "Capitol Words" dataset
integrated into ``textacy`` (see :ref:`ref-api-datasets` for details). The data
is downloadable from the `textacy-data GitHub repository
<https://github.com/bdewilde/textacy-data/releases/tag/capitol_words_py3_v1.0>`_.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> records = textacy.io.read_json(
    ...     'textacy/data/capitol_words/capitol-words-py3.json.gz',
    ...     mode='rt', lines=True)
    >>> for record in records:
    ...     doc = textacy.Doc(record['text'], metadata=record['title'])
    ...     print(doc)
    ...     # do stuff...
    ...     break
    Doc(159 tokens; "Mr. Speaker, 480,000 Federal employees are work...")

For this and a few other datasets, convenient ``Dataset`` classes are already
implemented in ``textacy`` to help users get up and running, faster:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import textacy.datasets  # note the import
    >>> cw = textacy.datasets.CapitolWords()
    >>> cw.download()
    >>> records = cw.records(speaker_name={'Hillary Clinton', 'Barack Obama'})
    >>> text_stream, metadata_stream = textacy.io.split_records(records, 'text')

Make a Corpus
-------------

A ``texacy.Corpus`` is an ordered collection of ``textacy.Doc`` s, all processed
by the same spacy language pipeline. Let's continue with the Capitol Words dataset
and make a corpus from text and metadata streams (**Note:** This may take a
few minutes):

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> corpus = textacy.Corpus('en', texts=text_stream, metadatas=metadata_stream)
    >>> corpus
    Corpus(1241 docs; 857058 tokens)

As for a ``textacy.Doc``, the language pipeline used to analyze the texts in a
corpus is configurable, and metadata is optional. You can also add in already-
processed ``Doc`` s instead of raw texts.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> textacy.Corpus(
    ...     textacy.load_spacy('en_core_web_sm', disable=('parser', 'tagger')),
    ...     texts=cw.texts(speaker_party='R', chamber='House', limit=100))
    Corpus(100 docs; 31410 tokens)

You can use basic indexing as well as flexible boolean queries to select
documents in a corpus:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> corpus[-1]
    Doc(2999 tokens; "In the Federalist Papers, we often hear the ref...")
    >>> corpus[10:15]
    [Doc(44 tokens; "I thank the Chair. (The remarks of Mrs. Clinton..."),
     Doc(359 tokens; "My good friend from Connecticut raised an issue..."),
     Doc(83 tokens; "My question would be: In response to the discus..."),
     Doc(3338 tokens; "Madam President, I come to the floor today to s..."),
     Doc(221 tokens; "Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Tho...")]
    >>> obama_docs = list(corpus.get(lambda doc: doc.metadata['speaker_name'] == 'Barack Obama'))
    >>> len(obama_docs)
    411

It's important to note that all of the data in a ``textacy.Corpus`` is stored
in-memory, which makes a number of features much easier to implement.
Unfortunately, this means that the maximum size of a corpus will be bound by RAM.

Analyze a Corpus
----------------

There are lots of ways to analyze the data in a corpus. Basic stats are
computed on the fly as documents are added (or removed) from a corpus:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> corpus.n_docs, corpus.n_sents, corpus.n_tokens
    (1241, 33710, 858097)

You can transform a corpus into a document-term matrix, with flexible tokenization,
weighting, and filtering of terms:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> vectorizer = textacy.Vectorizer(
    ...     tf_type='linear', apply_idf=True, idf_type='smooth', norm='l2',
    ...     min_df=2, max_df=0.95)
    >>> doc_term_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(
    ...     (doc.to_terms_list(ngrams=1, named_entities=True, as_strings=True)
    ...      for doc in corpus))
    >>> print(repr(doc_term_matrix))
    <1241x11800 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'
	    with 225946 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

From a doc-term matrix, you can then train and interpret a topic model:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> model = textacy.TopicModel('nmf', n_topics=10)
    >>> model.fit(doc_term_matrix)
    >>> doc_topic_matrix = model.transform(doc_term_matrix)
    >>> doc_topic_matrix.shape
    (1241, 10)
    >>> for topic_idx, top_terms in model.top_topic_terms(vectorizer.id_to_term, top_n=10):
    ...     print('topic', topic_idx, ':', '   '.join(top_terms))
    topic 0 : -PRON-      new   people   senator   's   work   york   bill   the
    topic 1 : rescind   quorum   order   unanimous   consent   ask   president   -PRON-   mr.   madam
    topic 2 : dispense   reading   unanimous   consent   amendment   ask   -PRON-   president   mr.   madam
    topic 3 : student   school   education   college   child   teacher   program   high   loan   graduate
    topic 4 : desire   chamber   be   senators   vote   voter   rollcall   objection   2313   regular
    topic 5 : amendment   pend   aside   set   ask   -PRON-   unanimous   consent   no   mr.
    topic 6 : health   care   child   mental   patient   quality   medical      program   system
    topic 7 : iraq   war   troop   iraqi   iraqis   military   policy      escalation   u.s.
    topic 8 : session   authorize   unanimous   consent   senate   p.m.   a.m.   september   committee   hearing
    topic 9 : security   homeland   funding   9/11   commission   risk   department   threat   emergency   police

And we're just getting started! For now, though, I encourage you to pick a dataset
--- either your own or one already included in ``textacy`` --- and start exploring
the data. *Most* functionality is well-documented via in-code docstrings; to see
that information all together in nicely-formatted HTML, be sure to check out
the :ref:`ref-api-reference`.
